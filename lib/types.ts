/* Schedule types */

/*
Note: each character has a schedule. It should roughly adhere to the Intra schedule (especially wake-up, meals, and lights-out). Each person wakes has a room assigned to them, Quarters_John/etc, that they sleep in.

Events may overlap, in which case the person may choose different activities on different days.

Each person should have one or more secret activities. These are activities that they don't want other people to know about, which might be embarassing or secret for another reason. These activities can overlap with other activities, and don't need to be long. (E.g., a 10 minute secret activity is fine). Make the secret activities interesting, silly, and fun.

All activities should express the absurdity of the environment and the strong personality of each character.
